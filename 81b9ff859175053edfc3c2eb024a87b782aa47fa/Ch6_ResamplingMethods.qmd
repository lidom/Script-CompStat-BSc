# Resampling Methods {#sec-resamplingmethods}

> Reading: Chapter 5 of our course textbook [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](https://www.statlearning.com/) 


**Resampling methods** involve repeatedly drawing samples from a *training data set* and refitting a model of interest on each of these samples. The different estimation results across resamples can be used, for instance, to estimate the variability of a linear regression fit. 


In the following, we consider the resampling methods:

* Cross-Validation and
* Bootstrap 


## Cross-Validation

In this section, we consider a class of methods that estimate the
test error rate by holding out a subset of the training observations from the fitting process, and then applying the statistical learning method to those held out observations.


### Validation Set Approach

The validation set approach randomly divides the available set of observations into two parts: 

* a *training set* and 
* a *validation set* (or hold-out set)

The model is fit on the training set, and the fitted model is used to predict the responses for the observations in the validation set.

#### Illustration {-}

Reconsider the `Auto` data set. In Chapter 3, we found that a model that predicts `mpg` using `horsepower` and `horsepower`$^2$ predicts better than a model that uses only the linear term. But maybe a cubic or a higher order polynomial regression model predicts even better? The validation set approach can be used to select the degree $p$ of the polynomial regression model
$$
\texttt{mpg}=\beta_0 + \sum_{j=1}^p\beta_j \texttt{horsepower}^j + \epsilon.
$$


**Step 1:** Randomly split the total data set into mutually exclusive training and test (validation) sets of roughly equal subsample sizes:

* **Training set:** $\{(x_i,y_i), i\in\mathcal{I}_{Train}\},$ where $n_{Train}=|\mathcal{I}_{Train}|<n$
* **Test set:** $\{(x_i,y_i), i\in\mathcal{I}_{Test}\},$ where $n_{Test}=|\mathcal{I}_{Test}|<n$

such that $n_{Train}\approx n_{Test}$ with $n=n_{Train} + n_{Test}$ and 
$$
\mathcal{I}_{Train}\cap \mathcal{I}_{Test}=\emptyset.
$$
Code for splitting data randomly into training and validation sets:
```{r}
library("ISLR2")
data("Auto")

n        <- nrow(Auto)    # Sample size
n_Train  <- 200           # Sample size of training set 
n_Test  <- n - n_Train   # Sample size of test/validation set 

set.seed(1234) 

## Index-Sets for selecting the training and validation sets
I_Train  <- sample(x = 1:n, size = n_Train, replace = FALSE)
I_Test  <- c(1:n)[-I_Train]

## Training data
Auto_Train_df <- Auto[I_Train, ]
## Testing (validation) data 
Auto_Test_df <- Auto[I_Test, ]
```


**Step 2:** Estimation of the polynomial regression model, e.g., for $p=2$ using the training set:

```{r}
p            <- 2
Train_polreg <- lm(mpg ~ poly(horsepower, degree = p, raw=TRUE), 
                   data = Auto_Train_df)
```

**Step 3:** Validation of the polynomial regression model by computing the test mean squared (prediction) error using the validation set:
$$
\begin{align*}
\widehat{\operatorname{MSE}}_{Test}^{ValidationSetApproach}
&=\frac{1}{n_{Test}}\sum_{i\in\mathcal{I}_{Test}}(y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2\\[2ex]
&=\frac{1}{n_{Test}}\sum_{i\in\mathcal{I}_{Test}}\left(y_i - \hat{f}(x_i)\right)^2
\end{align*}
$$
where $\hat{f}$ is computed from the training data, but evaluated 
$$
\hat{y}_i=\hat{f}(x_i)
$$ 
at the test data $x_i,$ $i\in\mathcal{I}_{Test}.$

```{r}
y_fit_Test   <- predict(Train_polreg, newdata = Auto_Test_df)
RSS_Test     <- sum((Auto_Test_df$mpg - y_fit_Test)^2)
MSE           <- RSS_Test / n_Test
```

Repeating Steps 1-3 for a series of polynomial degrees $p=1,\dots,10$ allows us to search for the polynomial degree with lowest test MSE. 

```{r}
#| label: fig-VA1
#| fig-cap: Testing error estimates for a single split into training and testing datasets. This result suggests that $p=9$ minimizes the test MSE; however, the test MSE values for polynomial degrees from $p=2$ to $p=10$ are all of comparable order of magnitude.
p_max         <- 10
MSE           <- numeric(p_max)
for(p in 1:p_max){
  ## Step 1
  Train_polreg <- lm(mpg ~ poly(horsepower, degree = p, raw=TRUE), 
                     data = Auto_Train_df)
  ## Step 2
  y_fit_Test   <- predict(Train_polreg, newdata = Auto_Test_df)
  ## Step 3
  RSS_Test     <- sum( (Auto_Test_df$mpg - y_fit_Test)^2 )
  MSE[p]        <- RSS_Test / n_Test
}

plot(x = 1:p_max, y = MSE, type = "b", 
     col = "black", bg = "black", pch = 21,  
     xlab = "Degree of Polynomial", ylab = "MSE")
points(y = MSE[which.min(MSE)], 
       x = c(1:p_max)[which.min(MSE)], 
       col = "red", bg = "red", pch = 21)     
```


@fig-VA1 shows the test MSE values based on **one** random split of the dataset. The result that $p=9$ minimizes the test MSE, however, may depend on the random split. Different random splits may lead to different model selection (choices of $p$). 

The following code repeats the above computations for multiple random splits of the dataset into training and validation sets:
```{r}
#| label: fig-VA2
#| fig-cap: Test error estimates for ten different random splits into training and test data sets. The polynomial degrees that minimize the test MSE strongly vary across the different random splits.
## R = 10 random splits
R        <- 10
## Container for the MSE results
MSE      <- matrix(NA, R, p_max)

for(r in 1:R){
  ## Index sets for training and  sets
  I_Train  <- sample(x = 1:n, size = n_Train, replace = FALSE)
  I_Test  <- c(1:n)[-I_Train]

  ## Training set 
  Auto_Train_df <- Auto[I_Train, ]
  ## Test set
  Auto_Test_df <- Auto[I_Test, ]

  for(p in 1:p_max){
    ## Step 1
    Train_polreg <- lm(mpg ~ poly(horsepower, degree = p, raw = TRUE), 
                       data = Auto_Train_df)
    ## Step 2
    y_fit_Test   <- predict(Train_polreg, newdata = Auto_Test_df)
    ## Step 3
    RSS_Test     <- sum( (Auto_Test_df$mpg - y_fit_Test)^2 )
    MSE[r,p]      <- RSS_Test / n_Test
  }
}

matplot(y = t(MSE), type="b", ylab="MSE", xlab="Degree of Polynomial", 
        pch=21, col="black", bg="black", lty = 1, main="")
for(r in 1:R){
  points(y = MSE[r,][which.min(MSE[r,])], 
       x = c(1:p_max)[which.min(MSE[r,])], 
       col = "red", bg = "red", pch = 21)
}
```


@fig-VA2 shows that the validation set approach can be highly variable. The selected polynomial degrees (minimal test MSE) strongly varies across the different random splits and thus depend on the data included in the test and test sets. 

A further serious problem with the validation set approach is that the evaluated predictions $\hat{y}_i=\hat{f}(x_i)$ are based on estimates $\hat{f}$ computed from the training set, where, however, the training set sample size $n_{Train}$ is typically substantially smaller than the actual sample size $n.$ This leads to **increased (i.e. biased) test MSE values** which do not reflect the actual test MSE values for the total sample size $n.$

Leave-One-Out and $k$-fold *Cross-validation* are refinements of the validation set approach that addresses these issues. 

### Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV) 

Like the validation set approach, LOOCV involves splitting the total dataset into a training and a test part. 

However, instead of creating two subsets of comparable size, a **single** observation is used for the test  set, and the remaining observations are used for the training set. , i.e.

* **Training set:** $\{(x_1,y_1),\dots,(x_{i-1},y_{i-1}),(x_{i+1},y_{i+1}),\dots,(x_{n},y_{n})\}$ with $n_{Train}=n-1$
* **Test set:** $\{(x_i,y_i)\}$ with $n_{Test}=1$ 

The $i$th estimate for the test MSE is thus
$$
\begin{align*}
\widehat{\operatorname{MSE}}_{Test,i} 
&= \left(y_i - \hat{y}_i\right)^2\\[2ex]
&= \left(y_i - \hat{f}(x_i)\right)^2,
\end{align*}
$$
where $\hat{f}$ is computed from the $n_{Train}=n-1$ training data points, but evaluated 
$$
\hat{y}_i=\hat{f}(x_i)
$$ 
at the one test data point $x_i,$ $i\in\mathcal{I}_{Test}.$


Since $\hat{f}$ is essentially based on the total dataset, $\widehat{\operatorname{MSE}}_{Test,i}$ is an (approximately) unbiased (since $n_{Train}=n-1\approx n$) estimate for the test MSE, although a poor estimate with a high variance as it is based on only one observation in the test set.

Repeating this leave-one-out splitting approach for each $i=1,\dots,n,$ produces $n$ many estimates of the test MSE:
$$
\widehat{\operatorname{MSE}}_{Test,1}, 
\widehat{\operatorname{MSE}}_{Test,2},\dots,
\widehat{\operatorname{MSE}}_{Test,n}
$$

The LOOCV estimate is then formed by the average of the $n$ MSE estimates:
$$
\operatorname{LOOCV}=\operatorname{CV}_{(n)} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n\widehat{\operatorname{MSE}}_{Test,i}.
$${#eq-LOOCV}

Figure 5.3 shows schematically the leave-one-out data splitting approach. 

![](images/Fig_5_3.png)


Advantages of CV over the Validation Set approach: 

1. Lower bias. Since the test MSE estimates are based on training sets with sample sizes 
$$
n_{Train}=n-1 \approx n
$$ 
LOOCV does not overestimate the test error rate as much the validation set approach does. 
2. Performing LOOCV multiple times, always yields the same result. I.e., there is no randomness due to the training/testing set splits as seen for the validation set approach.

Codes to implement the LOOCV approach for the `Auto` data example: 
```{r}
#| label: fig-CV1
#| fig-cap: LOOCV error estimates for different polynomial degrees $p.$

MSE_i      <- matrix(NA, n, p_max)

## Save starting time of the loop
start_time <- Sys.time()

for(r in 1:n){
  ## Training set 
  Auto_Train_df <- Auto[-r, ]
  ## Testing set
  Auto_Test_df <- Auto[r, ]

  for(p in 1:p_max){
    ## Step 1
    Train_polreg <- lm(mpg ~ poly(horsepower, degree = p, raw = TRUE), 
                       data = Auto_Train_df)
    ## Step 2
    y_fit_Test   <- predict(Train_polreg, newdata = Auto_Test_df)
    ## Step 3
    MSE_i[r,p]    <- (Auto_Test_df$mpg - y_fit_Test)^2  
  }
}
## Save end time of the loop
end_time <- Sys.time()

LOOCV  <- colMeans(MSE_i)

plot(x = 1:p_max, y = LOOCV, type = "b", 
     col = "black", bg = "black", pch = 21,  
     xlab = "Degree of Polynomial", ylab = "LOOCV")
points(y = LOOCV[which.min(LOOCV)], 
       x = c(1:p_max)[which.min(LOOCV)], 
       col = "red", bg = "red", pch = 21)     
```


#### **CV: (Often) Computationally Expensive** {-}

LOOCV has the potential to be **computationally expensive**, since the model has to be fit $n$ times. Indeed the above code, which represents a rather simple implementation of LOOCV for least squares fits of linear regression models, takes  
<center>
`end_time`$-$`start_time` $=$ `r round(end_time-start_time,3)` seconds
</center>
for the computations which is quite long. 

Luckily, for least squares fits of linear/polynomial regression models one can use the following short-cut formula
$$
\begin{align*}
\operatorname{LOOCV}
&=\operatorname{CV}_{(n)} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n\left(\frac{y_i - \hat{y}_i}{1-h_i}\right)^2,
%&=\operatorname{CV}_{(n)} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n\left(\frac{y_i - \hat{y}_i}{1-h_i}\right)^2
\end{align*}
$${#eq-CVfast} 
where 

* $\hat{y}_i$ is the $i$th fitted value from the *original least squares fit,* based on the total sample size $n,$ and 
* $h_i$ is the leverage statistic for the $i$th observation, i.e. 
$$
h_i=\left[X(X'X)^{-1}X'\right]_{ii}.
$$

The following codes implement this fast LOOCV version:
```{r}

LOOCV_fast <- numeric(p_max)

## Save starting time 
start_time2 <- Sys.time()

for(p in 1:p_max){
  PolyReg <- lm(mpg ~ poly(horsepower, degree = p, raw = TRUE), 
                           data = Auto)
  h             <- lm.influence(PolyReg)$hat
  LOOCV_fast[p] <- mean(((Auto$mpg - fitted.values(PolyReg))/(1 - h))^2)
}
## Save end time of the loop
end_time2 <- Sys.time()
```

Indeed, both approaches yield the same LOOCV values 
```{r}
## Minimal absolute difference between 
## the naive and the fast implementation: 
round(max(abs(LOOCV - LOOCV_fast)), 5)
```
However, the fast version takes only 
<center>
`end_time2`$-$`start_time2` $=$ `r round(end_time2-start_time2,3)` seconds
</center>
for the computations. 


LOOCV is a very general method, and can be used with any kind of
predictive modeling; e.g.

* Logistic regression
* Linear discriminant analysis
* Quadratic discriminant analysis
* etc.

and any statistical prediction method discussed in the lecture or in our textbook `ISLR2`. 


**Caution:** The fast LOOCV @eq-CVfast does not hold in general, but only for least squares fits of linear regression models, which includes, for instance, polynomial regressions, but, for instance, not logistic regression models.  

## $k$-Fold Cross-Validation

An alternative to LOOCV is $k$-fold CV. 

This approach divides the total index set $\mathcal{I}=\{1,2,\dots,n\}$ of the original data data set into $k$ mutually exclusive subsets (folds) of roughly equal sizes 
$$
\mathcal{I}_1,\,\mathcal{I}_2,\dots,\mathcal{I}_k
$$
with $|\mathcal{I}_1|\approx |\mathcal{I}_k|\approx n/k.$

These $k$ index sets allow us construct different training and test sets for each $j=1,2,\dots,k$

* **Training set:** $\{(x_i,y_i),\; i\in\mathcal{I}\setminus \mathcal{I}_j\}$ with sample size of $n_{Train}\approx n - n/k$
* **Test set:** $\{(x_i,y_i),\;i\in\mathcal{I}_j\}$ with sample size of $n_{Test}\approx n/k$ 

Each pair of training and test set allows to compute an estimate of the test error
$$
\widehat{\operatorname{MSE}}_{Test,1}, 
\widehat{\operatorname{MSE}}_{Test,2},\dots,
\widehat{\operatorname{MSE}}_{Test,k},
$$
where
$$
\begin{align*}
\widehat{\operatorname{MSE}}_{Test,j}
&=\frac{1}{|\mathcal{I}_j|}\sum_{i\in\mathcal{I}_j}\left(y_i - \hat{y}_i\right)^2\\[2ex]
&=\frac{1}{|\mathcal{I}_j|}\sum_{i\in\mathcal{I}_j}\left(y_i - \hat{f}(x_i)\right)^2,\quad j=1,\dots,k,
\end{align*}
$$
with $\hat{f}$ being computed from the training data, but evaluated at the test data.  

The $k$-fold CV estimate is computed by averaging these values
$$
\operatorname{CV}_{(k)}=\frac{1}{k}\sum_{j=1}^k\widehat{\operatorname{MSE}}_{Test,j}
$${#eq-kfoldCV}

Figure 5.5 illustrates the data splitting for $k$-fold CV.

![](images/Fig_5_5.png)


* LOOCV is a special case of $k$-fold CV with $k=n$. 

* Most often used $k$-values in practice are $k=5$ or $k=10$. 

**Why $k=5$ or $k=10$ instead of $k=n$?**

* Faster computation times ($k=5$ instead of $k=n$ model fits)
* Improved estimates of the test MSE (see next section)

The following codes illustrate $k$-fold CV:
```{r}
set.seed(123)

## number of folds for k-fold CV 
k              <- 5

## container for storing the MSE results
MSE_folds      <- matrix(NA, k, p_max)

## selector for the folds 
folds          <- sample(rep(1:k, length = n))

## Save starting time of the loop
start_time     <- Sys.time()

for(j in 1:k){
  ## Training set 
  Auto_Train_df <- Auto[folds != j, ]
  ## Testing set
  Auto_Test_df <- Auto[folds == j, ]

  for(p in 1:p_max){
    ## Step 1
    Train_polreg <- lm(mpg ~ poly(horsepower, degree = p, raw = TRUE), 
                       data = Auto_Train_df)
    ## Step 2
    y_fit_Test    <- predict(Train_polreg, newdata = Auto_Test_df)
    ## Step 3
    MSE_folds[j,p] <- mean((Auto_Test_df$mpg - y_fit_Test)^2)
  }
}
## Save end time of the loop
end_time  <- Sys.time()

CV_kfold  <- colMeans(MSE_folds)

plot(x = 1:p_max, y = CV_kfold, type = "b", 
     col = "black", bg = "black", pch = 21,  main="k-fold CV", 
     xlab = "Degree of Polynomial", ylab = expression("CV"[k]))
points(y = CV_kfold[which.min(CV_kfold)], 
       x = c(1:p_max)[which.min(CV_kfold)], 
       col = "red", bg = "red", pch = 21)     
```


### Bias-Variance Trade-Off for $k$-Fold Cross-Validation

There is a bias-variance trade-off associated with the choice of $k$ in $k$-fold CV.

<!-- A small $k$ leads to biased test MSE estimates (systematic overestimations). -->

**Bias:**

* Small $k$ lead to test MSE estimates with large **bias**
* Large $k$ lead to test MSE estimates with small **bias**

*Explanation:*

* A small $k$ leads to trainings sets with samples sizes $n_{Train} \ll n$ substantially smaller than the actual sample size $n.$ Thus, we estimate the MSE for a sample size that is substantially smaller than the sample size $n$ we are actually interested in. This leads to systematic overestimations of the actual test MSE for sample size $n.$ 

* A large $k$ reduces this bias since $n_{Train}\approx n.$ Thus we estimate essentially the actual test MSE for sample size $n.$ 


**Variance:**

* Small $k$ lead to test MSE estimates with small **variance**
* Large $k$ lead to test MSE estimates with large **variance**

*Explanation:* 

* In $k$-fold CV, the training sets overlap pairwise by roughly $((k-2)/k)\times 100 \%$. 
  * For $k=2$ there is no overlap. 
  * For $k=5$ ($k$-fold CV) approximately $(k-2)/k=(3/5)=60\%$ of the training data points are equal in each pair of training sets.
  * For $k=n$ (LOOCV) approximately $(n-2)/n=98\%$ of the training data points are equal in each pair of trainings sets. 

Thus, the larger $k$ the more similar the training data sets become. However, very similar training sets lead to highly correlated test MSE estimates
$$
\widehat{\operatorname{MSE}}_{Test,1},\widehat{\operatorname{MSE}}_{Test,2},\dots,\widehat{\operatorname{MSE}}_{Test,k}.
$$
Since the (sample) mean 
$$
\operatorname{CV}_{(k)}=\frac{1}{k}\sum_{j=1}^k\widehat{\operatorname{MSE}}_{Test,j}
$$
of highly correlated quantities has higher variance than the (sample) mean of quantities that are not as highly correlated, the test error estimate resulting from LOOCV tends to have higher variance than does the test error estimate resulting from $k$-fold CV with $k<n.$ 

$k$-fold CV with $k=5$ or $k=10$ is often considered a good compromise balancing these bias and variance issues. 

### Cross-Validation on Classification Problems

Cross-validation can also be a very useful approach in the classification setting when $Y$ is qualitative.

In the classification setting, the LOOCV error rate takes the form
$$
\operatorname{CV}_{(n)}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n\operatorname{Err}_{Test,i},
$$
where 
$$
\operatorname{Err}_{Test,i}=I(y_i\neq \hat{y}_i)
$$
with $I(\texttt{TRUE})=1$ and $I(\texttt{FALSE})=0.$

Analogously for the $k$-fold CV error rate and the validation set error rate.

We can, for instance, determine the degree $d$ in logistic regression models
$$
\log\left(\frac{p(X)}{1-p(X)}\right)=\beta_0 +\sum_{j=1}^d X_j^d 
$$
by selecting that polynomial degree $d$ that minimizes the CV error rate.

Likewise, one can select the tuning parameter $K$ in KNN classification by minimizing the CV error rate across different candidate values for $K.$


## The Bootstrap

The bootstrap is a widely applicable and powerful statistical tool to quantify the uncertainty associated with a given estimator or statistical learning method.

#### **Illustration** {-}

Suppose that we wish to invest a fixed sum of money in two financial assets that yield returns of $X$ and $Y.$ These returns $X$ and $Y$ are random with 

* $Var(X)=\sigma^2_X$
* $Var(Y)=\sigma^2_Y$ 
* $Cov(X,Y)=\sigma_{XY}$

We want to invest a fraction $\alpha\in(0,1)$ in $X$ and invest the remaining $1-\alpha$ in $Y.$

Our aim is to minimize the variance (risk) of our investment, i.e., we want to minimize
$$
Var\left(\alpha X + (1-\alpha)Y\right).
$$ 
One can show that the value $\alpha$ that minimizes this variance is
$$
\alpha = \frac{\sigma^2_Y - \sigma_{XY}}{\sigma^2_X + \sigma^2_Y - 2\sigma_{XY}}.
$${#eq-alpha}
Using a data set that contains past measurements 
$$
((X_1,Y_1),\dots,(X_n,Y_n))
$$
for $X$ and $Y,$ we can estimate the unknown $\alpha$ by plugging in estimates of the variances and covariances
$$
\hat\alpha = \frac{\hat\sigma^2_Y - \hat\sigma_{XY}}{\hat\sigma^2_X + \hat\sigma^2_Y - 2\hat\sigma_{XY}}
$${#eq-alphahat}
with 
$$
\begin{align*}
\hat{\sigma}^2_X&=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n\left(X_i-\bar{X}\right)^2\\ 
\hat{\sigma}^2_Y&=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n\left(Y_i-\bar{Y}\right)^2\\ 
\hat{\sigma}_{XY}&=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n\left(X_i-\bar{X}\right)\left(Y_i-\bar{Y}\right),
\end{align*}
$$
where $\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i,$ and likewise for $\bar{Y}.$

It is natural to wish to quantify the accuracy of our estimate $\hat\alpha\approx \alpha.$ I.e., we wish to know the standard error of the estimator $\hat\alpha$, 
$$
\sqrt{Var(\hat\alpha)} = \operatorname{SE}(\hat\alpha)=?
$$
Computing $\operatorname{SE}(\hat\alpha)$ is here difficult due to the definition of $\hat\alpha$ in @eq-alphahat which contains variance estimates also in the denominator. 


#### **The Infeasible Bootstrap: A Monte Carlo Simulation** {-}

Let us, for a moment, assume that we know the distributions of $X$ and $Y.$ And, for simplicity, let's say 
$$
\left(\begin{matrix}X\\ Y\end{matrix}\right) \sim F_{(X,Y)}, 
$$
where $F_{(X,Y)}$ is the distribution function of the bi-variate normal distribution
$$
\mathcal{N}\left(\left(\begin{matrix}0\\0\end{matrix}\right),\left[\begin{matrix}\sigma_X^2&\sigma_{XY}\\\sigma_{XY}&\sigma_{Y}^2\end{matrix}\right]\right).
$${#eq-MCDistr}


If this were true, i.e., if we would know the true population distribution of $X$ and $Y,$ we could simply generate a new dataset containing new observations for $X$ and $Y$ that allows us to compute a new estimate $\hat\alpha.$ 

Repeatedly generating new datasets $((X_1,Y_1),\dots,(X_n,Y_n))$ by sampling new observations from the (here assumed) true population distribution @eq-MCDistr, for instance, $B=1000$ many times, would allow us to compute $B=1000$ estimates  
$$
\hat\alpha_1,\;\hat\alpha_2,\dots,\hat\alpha_{B}.
$$
The empirical standard deviation 
$$
\sqrt{\frac{1}{B}\sum_{b=1}^B\left(\hat\alpha_b - \bar{\alpha}\right)^2},\quad\text{with}\quad \bar{\alpha} = \frac{1}{B}\sum_{b=1}^B\hat\alpha_b,
$$
is then a very good estimate of the (unknown) true $\operatorname{SE}(\hat\alpha).$

Indeed, by the law of large numbers this sample standard deviation consistently estimates the true $\operatorname{SE}(\hat\alpha)$ as $B\to\infty,$ provided that we sample from the **true** population distribution $F_{(X,Y)}.$ 

`R` code for doing this Monte Carlo simulation:
```{r}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library("MASS")) # for mvrnorm()

n        <- 100 # sample size

## Next: Defining the (usually unknown) population 
## distribution of (X,Y) ~ F_XY, where F_XY is 
## assumed to be a Bi-variate normal distribution 
## with the following parameters: 
mu_X     <- 0
mu_Y     <- 0

sigma2_X <- 3
sigma2_Y <- 4
sigma_XY <- 1

Sigma    <- rbind(c(sigma2_X, sigma_XY), 
                  c(sigma_XY, sigma2_Y))


## The true (usually unknown) alpha value: 
alpha_true  <- (sigma2_Y - sigma_XY) / (sigma2_X + sigma2_X - 2 * sigma_XY)                  


## Infeasible Bootstrap (i.e. a Monte Carlo (MC) Simulation)
set.seed(333)

B            <- 1000
alpha_hat_MC <- numeric(B)

for(b in 1:B){
  dat             <- mvrnorm(n = n, mu = c(mu_X, mu_Y), Sigma = Sigma)
  X               <- dat[,1]
  Y               <- dat[,2]
  ##
  sigma2_X_hat    <- var(X)
  sigma2_Y_hat    <- var(Y)
  sigma_XY_hat    <- cov(X,Y)
  ##
  alpha_hat_MC[b] <- (sigma2_Y_hat - sigma_XY_hat) / (sigma2_X_hat + sigma2_X_hat - 2 * sigma_XY_hat)
}

## Estimate of the standard error of the estimates for alpha:
sd(alpha_hat_MC)
```


Thus, this Monte Carlo simulation estimates that the true standard error equals `r sd(alpha_hat_MC)`, i.e. 
<center>
$\operatorname{SE}(\hat\alpha) \approx$ `sd(alpha_hat_MC)` $=$ `r sd(alpha_hat_MC)`,
</center>
and by the law of large number (large `B`), we can expect this estimation to be really good and reliable. 

But, unfortunately, this result depends on our **completely** unrealistic assumption that we know the true population distribution $F_{(X,Y)}$ of $(X,Y),$ which makes this simple resampling approach infeasible in practice. 😭


#### **The Actual (Feasible) Bootstrap** {-}

Fortunately, we can use the **empirical cumulative distribution function** $F_{n,(X,Y)}$ from the originally observed dataset of past measurements for $X$ and $Y,$ as an approximation to the true (unknown) population distribution $F_{(X,Y)}$, 
$$
F_{n,(X,Y)}\approx F_{(X,Y)}.
$$

So, instead of resampling from an unknown population distribution $F_{(X,Y)},$ which is not possible in practice, since $F_{(X,Y)}$ is typically unknown, we resample from the empirical distribution $F_{n,(X,Y)},$ which is easily possible in practice. 🥳

This idea will work well, as long as $F_{n,(X,Y)}$ serves as a good approximation of $F_{(X,Y)}$ which will always be the case if the sample size $n$ is sufficiently large since, by the famous [Glivenko-Cantelli Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glivenko%E2%80%93Cantelli_theorem), $F_{n,(X,Y)}$ is uniformly consistent for $F_{(X,Y)}.$

Sampling from an empirical cdf $F_{n}$ simply means sampling from the observed dataset $(X_i,Y_i)$, $i=1,\dots,n$, **with replacement**, for instance like this:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
bootstrap_sample <- sample(x = 1:n, n, replace = TRUE)
bootstrap_data   <- data_frame[bootstrap_sample, ]
```

In order to illustrate the bootstrap, let us generate some artificial data. We use again the bi-variate normal distribution as in the "infeasible bootstrap" illustration. 
```{r}
## Generate some artificial data 
observed_data  <- mvrnorm(n = n, mu = c(mu_X, mu_Y), Sigma = Sigma)
```

If the bootstrap works, then the bootstrap estimate of the standard error $\operatorname{SE}(\hat\alpha)$ should be close to the infeasible Monte Carlo estimate, even though the bootstrap method does not explicitly use the true data generating process, but only the observed data.  

The following code implements the bootstrap:
```{r}
set.seed(123)
## Bootstrap 
B              <- 1000
alpha_hat_boot <- numeric(B)

for(b in 1:B){
  bootstrap_sample  <- sample(x = 1:n, n, replace = TRUE)
  bootstrap_data    <- observed_data[bootstrap_sample, ]
  ##
  X                 <- bootstrap_data[,1]
  Y                 <- bootstrap_data[,2]
  ##
  sigma2_X_hat      <- var(X)
  sigma2_Y_hat      <- var(Y)
  sigma_XY_hat      <- cov(X,Y)
  ##
  alpha_hat_boot[b] <- (sigma2_Y_hat - sigma_XY_hat) / (sigma2_X_hat + sigma2_X_hat - 2 * sigma_XY_hat)
}

## Estimate of the standard error of the estimates for alpha:
sd(alpha_hat_boot)
```

The bootstrap estimate of the true standard error equals `r sd(alpha_hat_boot)`, i.e. 
<center>
$\operatorname{SE}(\hat\alpha) \approx$ `sd(alpha_hat_boot)` $=$ `r sd(alpha_hat_boot)`.
</center>
This is really close to the infeasible Monte Carlo simulation based estimate `sd(alpha_hat_MC)` $=$ `r sd(alpha_hat_MC)`, but without making use of the unknown data generating process. 

> The bootstrap method is attributed to Bradley Efron, who received the *[International Prize in Statistics](https://statprize.org/pdfs/2019-Efron-Announcement.pdf)* (the Nobel price of statistics) for his seminal works on the bootstrap method. 






## Self-Study: Exercises

Prepare the following exercises of Chapter 5 in our course textbook: 

- Exercise 3
<!-- - Exercise 4 -->
- Exercise 5
<!-- - Exercise 6 -->
- Exercise 8




### Solutions

#### Exercise 3 {-}

We now review k-fold cross-validation.

**3 a)** Explain how k-fold cross-validation is implemented.

**Answer:**

k-fold cross-validation is implemented by taking the set of $n$ observations and randomly splitting into $K$ non-overlapping groups of roughly equal group-size (approx. $n/K$). To compute the $k$-th $(k=1,2,\dots,K)$ test MSE estimate, group $k$ is used as a validation set and the remainder as a training set. The test error is estimated by averaging the $K$ resulting test MSE estimates.

**3 b)** What are the advantages and disadvantages of $k$-fold cross-validation relative to: 

i) the validation set approach?

ii) LOOCV?

**Answer:**

The **validation set** approach is conceptually simple and easily implemented as you are simply partitioning the existing training data into two sets. However, there are two drawbacks: 

1. The estimate of the test MSE can be highly variable/instable; i.e. may strongly depend on which observations are included in the training and validation sets. 

2. The validation set error rate may tend to overestimate the test MSE for the actual model fit on the entire data set since the training set has a relatively small sample size in comparison to the actual data size $n$.

**LOOCV** is a special case of k-fold cross-validation with $k = n$. Thus, LOOCV is the computationally most expensive cross-validation method since the model must be fit $n$ times. Also, LOOCV has higher variance, but lower bias, than k-fold CV: On the one hand, the LOOCV cross-validation samples are highly correlated; one the other hand, the cross-validation samples are having sample sizes roughly equal to the actual sample size $(n-1\approx n).$

<!-- 
### Exercise 4 {-}

Suppose that we use some statistical learning method to make a prediction for the response $Y$ for a *particular* value of the predictor $X$. Carefully describe how we might estimate the standard deviation of our prediction.

**Answer:**

We can estimate the standard deviation of our prediction by using the bootstrap approach. 

Let $\hat{Y} = \hat{f}(X)$ denote the prediction of $Y$ for the given $X$. The bootstrap approach works by repeatedly ($B$ many times) sampling $n$ observations (with replacement) from the original data set, and to compute new prediction results for each re-sampled bootstrap datasets. This yields to $B$ many bootstrap predictions: 
$$
\hat{f}^*_1(X), \hat{f}^*_2(X), \dots, \hat{f}^*_B(X).
$$

Using these bootstrap predictions we can compute the standard deviation of our prediction by computing 
$$
\sqrt{\frac{1}{B}\sum^B_{b=1}\left(\hat{f}^*_b(X)-\left(\frac{1}{B}\sum_{r=1}^B\hat{f}^*_r(X)\right)\right)^2}.
$$

#### Exercise 5 {-}

Previously, we used logistic regression to predict the probability of `default` using `income` and `balance` on the `Default` dataset. We will now estimate the test error of this logistic regression model using the validation set approach. Do not forget to set a random seed before beginning your analysis.

**5 a)** Fit a logistic regression model that uses `income` and `balance` to predict `default`.

**Answer:**

```{r}
library("ISLR2")

# Attaching the data set
attach(Default) 

# Estimate a GLM model where "family=binomial" selects a logistic regression
glm.fit <- glm(default ~ income + balance, 
                data   = Default, 
                family = binomial)

# Use summary function to print the results
summary(glm.fit)
```


**5 b)** Using the validation set approach, estimate the test error of this model. In order to do this, you must perform the following steps: 

1. Split the sample set into a training set and a validation set.

2. Fit a multiple logistic regression model using only the training observations.

3. Obtain a prediction of default status for each individual in the validation set by computing the posterior probability of default for that individual, and classifying the individual to the default category if the posterior probability is greater than $0.5$.

4. Compute the validation set error, which is the fraction of the observations in the validation set that are misclassified.


**Answer:**

```{r}
## We are going to do similar tasks several times in this exercise. 
## Therefore, it's convenient to build a function:

fun5b <- function(){
    # sample(): takes a sample of the specified size from the elements of x using either with or without replacement.
    n     <- dim(Default)[1]
    train <- sample(x = n, size = round(n/2, 0), replace = FALSE)
    
    # logistic function fit (training dataset)
    glm.fit <- glm(default ~ income + balance, 
        data   = Default, 
        family = binomial, 
        subset = train)
    
    # predictions (test dataset)
    glm.pred  <- rep("No", times = round(n/2, 0))
    glm.probs <- predict(glm.fit, Default[-train, ], 
                         type = "response")
    glm.pred[glm.probs > 0.5] <- "Yes"
    
    # return the test (prediction) error rate 
    return(mean(glm.pred != Default[-train, ]$default))
}

## set seed
set.seed(1110)

## compute test prediction error using the 
## programmed validation set approach
fun5b()
```

**Answer:** There is a 2.62% test error rate from the validation set approach.

**5 c)** Repeat the process in (b) three times, using three different splits of the observations into a training set and a validation set. Comment on the results obtained.

```{r}
fun5b()
fun5b()
fun5b()
```

**Answer:** The estimates of the test error rates are in the range of 2.5% and 2.8% and are varying with respect to the different training and validation set splittings. 

**5 d)** Now consider a logistic regression model that predicts the probability of default using `income`, `balance`, and a dummy variable for `student`. Estimate the test error for this model using the validation set approach. Comment on whether or not including a dummy variable for `student` leads to a reduction in the test error rate.

**Answer:** 

```{r}
set.seed(1)

# generate our training data
n     <- dim(Default)[1]
train <- sample(n, round(n/2, 0))

# run regression on the training data subset
glm.fit <- glm(default ~ income + balance + student, 
                data   = Default, 
                family = binomial, 
                subset = train)

# test sample predictions
glm.pred <- rep("No", times = round(n/2, 0))

# fill with our predictions
glm.probs <- predict(glm.fit, Default[-train, ], 
                    type = "response")
glm.pred[glm.probs > 0.5] <- "Yes"

# test (prediction) error rate 
mean(glm.pred != Default[-train, ]$default)
```

**Answer:** 

The test error rate is 2.6%. Thus adding the `student` dummy variable to our specification doesn't appear to reduce the test error rate.

<!-- 

### Exercise 6 {-}

We continue to consider the use of a logistic regression model to predict the probability of `default` using `income` and `balance` on the `Default` data set. In particular, we will now compute estimates for the standard errors of the `income` and `balance` logistic regression coefficients in two different ways: (1) using the bootstrap, and (2) using the standard formula for computing the standard errors in the `glm()` function. Do not forget to set a random seed before beginning your analysis.

**6 a)** Using the `summary()` and `glm()` functions, determine the estimated standard errors for the coefficients associated with `income` and `balance` in a multiple logistic regression model that uses both predictors.

**Answer:** 

```{r}
# Same as in 5 a)

# Estimate a generalized linear regression model using glm(), 
# where the third function argument ('family') allows to specify 
# distribution---here, 'binomial' since our independent variable
# 'default' takes two values '0' and '1'

glm.fit <- glm(default ~ income + balance, 
                data   = Default, 
                family = binomial)

# Use summary function to print a summary of the the results
summary(glm.fit)
```

Using the standard formula for the standard errors in logistic regression:

* Estimated standard error of the parameter estimator `income`: $4.985 \cdot 10^{-06}$
* Estimated standard error of the parameter estimator `balance`: $2.274\cdot 10^{-04}$


**6 b)** Write a function, `boot_fn()`, that takes as input the `Default` data set as well as an `index` of the observations, and that outputs the coefficient estimates for `income` and `balance` in the multiple logistic regression model.

**Answer:** 

```{r}
boot_fn <- function(data, index){
    return(coef(glm(default ~ income + balance, 
                    data   = data, 
                    family = binomial, 
                    subset = index)))
}
```

**6 c)** Use the `boot()` function together with your `boot_fn()` function to estimate the standard errors of the logistic regression coefficients for `income` and `balance`.

**Answer:** 

```{r}
# install.packages("boot")

# Load the boot package
library("boot")

# Set seed
set.seed(1)

# The boot package provides extensive facilities for bootstrapping 
# and related resampling methods. 
boot(data = Default, statistic = boot_fn, R = 100)
```

**6 d)** Comment on the estimated standard errors obtained using the `glm()` function and using your bootstrap function.

**Answer:** 


* Estimated standard error (bootstrap version) of the parameter estimator `income`: $4.186 \cdot 10^{-06}$
  * The bootstrap approach estimates slightly smaller std errors for `income` than the classic standard formula. 
* Estimated standard error (bootstrap version) of the parameter estimator `balance`: $2.226\cdot 10^{-04}$
  * The bootstrap approach and the standard formula yield essentially equal results.

#### Exercise 8 {-}

We will now perform cross-validation on a simulated data set.

**8 a)** Generate a simulated data set as follows. 

```{r}
# set seed for rnorm function
set.seed(1)

# rnorm draws pseudo-random variables from a 
# (standard) normal distribution
x <- rnorm(100)
y <- x - 2 * x^2 + rnorm(100)
```

In this data set, what is $n$ and what is $p$? Write out the model used to generate the data in equation form.

**Answer:** 

- The sample size: $n=100$

- Number of predictors: $p=2$ 

- Model: $Y_i= X_i -2 \, X_i^2 + \epsilon_i$ with i.i.d. errors $\epsilon_i \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)$, $i=1,...,n=100$

**8 b)** Create a scatterplot of $X$ against $Y$. Comment on what you find.

**Answer:** 

```{r}
plot(x,y)
```

We can observe a quadratic relationship between $Y$ and $X.$ Moreover, $X$ ranges from about $-2$ to $2,$ while $Y$ ranges from about $-12$ to $2.$ The largest $Y$ values are observed for $X$ values around $0.$

**8 c)** Set a random seed, and then compute the LOOCV errors that result from fitting the following four models using least squares:

i. $Y = \beta_0 +\beta_1 X + \epsilon$

ii. $Y = \beta_0 +\beta_1 X + \beta_2 X^2 + \epsilon$

iii. $Y = \beta_0 +\beta_1 X + \beta_2 X^2 + \beta_3 X^3 + \epsilon$

iv. $Y = \beta_0 +\beta_1 X + \beta_2 X^2 + \beta_3 X^3 + \beta_4 X^4 + \epsilon$


**Answers:** 

```{r}
# call boot package (contains the cv.glm() function)
library(boot)

#set seed
set.seed(1)

# create data frame containing the simulated data for X and Y
Sim_Data <- data.frame(x, y)
```


**8 c i)** 


```{r}
# i
# Caution:
# This performes linear regression (no 'family' argument specified)
lm.fit_i <- glm(y ~ x, data = Sim_Data)

# cv.glm calculates the estimated K-fold cross-validation prediction
# error for generalized linear models (with K=n).
# '$delta' selects a vector of length two: 
# The first component is the raw cross-validation estimate of the 
# prediction error. 
# The second component is the adjusted cross-validation estimate. 
# (The adjustment is designed to compensate for bias.)
cv.glm(data   = Sim_Data, 
       glmfit = lm.fit_i, 
       K      = nrow(Sim_Data))$delta
```

**8 c ii)** 

```{r}
# ii 
# see ?poly for infos on poly()
lm.fit_ii <- glm(y ~ poly(x, 2, raw=TRUE), data = Sim_Data)
cv.glm(Sim_Data, lm.fit_ii, K = nrow(Sim_Data))$delta
```

**8 c iii)** 

```{r}
# iii
lm.fit_iii <- glm(y ~ poly(x, 3, raw=TRUE), data = Sim_Data)
cv.glm(Sim_Data, lm.fit_iii, K = nrow(Sim_Data))$delta
```

**8 c iv)** 

```{r}
# iv
lm.fit_iv <- glm(y ~ poly(x, 4, raw=TRUE), data = Sim_Data)
cv.glm(Sim_Data, lm.fit_iv, K = nrow(Sim_Data))$delta
```

<!-- 
**Conclusion:** The (correct) quadratic model has the smallest CV error.   
-->

**8. d)** Repeat (c) using another random seed, and report your results. Are your results the same as what you got in (c)? Why?

```{r}
set.seed(10)
# i.
lm.fit1 <- glm(y ~ x, data = Sim_Data)
cv.glm(Sim_Data, lm.fit1)$delta
# ii.
lm.fit2 <- glm(y ~ poly(x, 2, raw=TRUE), data = Sim_Data)
cv.glm(Sim_Data, lm.fit2)$delta
# iii.
lm.fit3 <- glm(y ~ poly(x, 3, raw=TRUE), data = Sim_Data)
cv.glm(Sim_Data, lm.fit3)$delta
# iv.
lm.fit4 <- glm(y ~ poly(x, 4, raw=TRUE), data = Sim_Data)
cv.glm(Sim_Data, lm.fit4)$delta
```

**Answer:** 

The results are exactly the same, because LOOCV will be the same since it evaluates n folds of a single observation.

**8 e)** Which of the models in (c) had the smallest LOOCV error? Is this what you expected? Explain your answer.

**Answer:** 

The quadratic polynomial had the lowest LOOCV test error rate. This was expected as it matches the true form of $Y$.

**8 f)** Comment on the statistical significance of the coefficient estimates that results from fitting each of the models in (c) using least squares. Do these results agree with the conclusions drawn based on the cross-validation results?

```{r}
summary(lm.fit1)
```

```{r}
summary(lm.fit2)
```

```{r}
summary(lm.fit3)
```

```{r}
summary(lm.fit4)
```

**Answer:** 

The $p$-values only show statistical significance of the linear and the quadratic predictor, which agrees with the CV-results.













## Self-Study: `R`-Lab Resampling Methods

In this lab, we explore the resampling techniques covered in this chapter. Some of the commands in this lab may take a while to run on your computer.

### The Validation Set Approach

We explore the use of the validation set approach in order to estimate the test error rates that result from fitting various linear models on the `Auto` data set.

Before we begin, we use the `set.seed()` function in order to set a for `R`'s random number generator, so that the (pseudo) random data splits are reproducible. 

We begin by using the `sample()` function to split the set of observations into two halves, by selecting a random subset of $196$ observations out of the original $392$ observations. We  refer to these observations as the training set.

```{r chunk1}
library("ISLR2")
attach(Auto)

## One half of the sample size
nrow(Auto)/2

set.seed(1)
train <- sample(x = 1:392, size = 196)
```

We then use the `subset` option in `lm()` to fit a linear regression using only the observations corresponding to the training set.

```{r chunk2}
lm.fit <- lm(mpg ~ horsepower, 
             data   = Auto, 
             subset = train)
```

We now  use the `predict()` function to estimate the response for all $392$ observations, and we  use the `mean()` function to calculate the MSE of the $196$ observations in the test dataset. Note that the `-train` index below selects  only the observations that are not in the training set.

```{r chunk3}
mean((mpg - predict(lm.fit, Auto))[-train]^2)
```

Therefore, the estimated test MSE for the linear regression fit is $23.27$. We can use the `poly()` function to estimate the test error for the quadratic and cubic regressions.

```{r chunk4}
lm.fit2 <- lm(mpg ~ poly(horsepower, 2), 
             data   = Auto, 
             subset = train)

## Test MSE 
mean((mpg - predict(lm.fit2, Auto))[-train]^2)


lm.fit3 <- lm(mpg ~ poly(horsepower, 3), 
             data   = Auto, 
             subset = train)
## Test MSE             
mean((mpg - predict(lm.fit3, Auto))[-train]^2)
```

These error rates are $18.72$ and $18.79$, respectively. If we choose a different training set instead, then we will obtain somewhat different errors on the testing set.

```{r chunk5}
set.seed(2)

## Polynomial degree 1
train  <- sample(x = 1:392, size = 196)
lm.fit <- lm(mpg ~ horsepower, subset = train)
mean((mpg - predict(lm.fit, Auto))[-train]^2)

## Polynomial degree 2
lm.fit2 <- lm(mpg ~ poly(horsepower, 2), data = Auto, 
    subset = train)
mean((mpg - predict(lm.fit2, Auto))[-train]^2)

## Polynomial degree 3
lm.fit3 <- lm(mpg ~ poly(horsepower, 3), data = Auto, 
    subset = train)
mean((mpg - predict(lm.fit3, Auto))[-train]^2)
```

Using this split of the observations into a training set and a testing set, we find that the validation set error rates for the models with linear, quadratic, and cubic terms are $25.73$, $20.43$, and $20.39$, respectively.

These results are consistent with our previous findings: a model that predicts `mpg` using a quadratic function of `horsepower` performs better than a model that involves only a linear function of `horsepower`, and there is little evidence that a model that uses a cubic function of `horsepower` performance substantially better.

### Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation {#sec-RLabLOOCV}

The LOOCV estimate can be automatically computed for any generalized linear model  using the `glm()` and `cv.glm()` functions.  In the lab for Chapter 4, we used the `glm()` function to perform logistic regression by passing in  the `family = "binomial"` argument. But if we use `glm()` to fit a model without passing in the `family` argument, then it  performs linear regression, just like the `lm()` function. So for instance,

```{r chunk6}
glm_fit <- glm(mpg ~ horsepower, data = Auto)
coef(glm_fit)
```

and

```{r chunk7}
lm.fit <- lm(mpg ~ horsepower, data = Auto)
coef(lm.fit)
```

yield identical linear regression models. In this lab, we will perform linear regression using the `glm()` function rather than the `lm()` function because the former can be used together with `cv.glm()`. The `cv.glm()` function is part of the `boot` library.

```{r chunk8}
## install.packages("boot")
library("boot")

glm_fit <- glm(mpg ~ horsepower, data = Auto)
cv.err  <- cv.glm(Auto, glm_fit)
cv.err$delta
```

The `cv.glm()` function produces a list with several components.  The two numbers in the `delta` vector contain the cross-validation results. In this case the numbers are identical (up to two decimal places) and correspond to the LOOCV statistic given in @eq-LOOCV. Below, we discuss a situation in which the two numbers differ. Our cross-validation estimate for the test error is approximately $24.23$.

We can repeat this procedure for increasingly complex polynomial fits.
 To automate the process, we use the  `for()` function to initiate a  which iteratively fits polynomial regressions for polynomials of order $i=1$ to $i=10$, computes the associated cross-validation error, and stores it in the $i$th element of the vector `cv_error`.
 We begin by initializing the vector. 

```{r chunk9}
cv_error <- rep(0, 10)
for (i in 1:10) {
  glm_fit     <- glm(mpg ~ poly(horsepower, i), 
                     data = Auto)
  cv_error[i] <- cv.glm(Auto, glm_fit)$delta[1]
}
plot(cv_error, type="b", ylab="Test MSE", xlab="Polynomial Degree",
     col = "black", bg = "black", pch = 21, main="LOOCV")
```
We see a sharp drop in the estimated test MSE between the linear and quadratic fits, but then no clear improvement from using higher-order polynomials.

### $k$-Fold Cross-Validation

The `cv.glm()` function can also be used to implement $k$-fold CV. Below we use $k=10$, a common choice for $k$, on the `Auto` data set. We once again set a random seed and initialize a vector in which we will store the CV errors corresponding to the polynomial fits of orders one to ten.

```{r chunk10}
set.seed(17)
cv_error_10 <- rep(0, 10)
for (i in 1:10) {
  glm_fit        <- glm(mpg ~ poly(horsepower, i), 
                        data = Auto)
  cv_error_10[i] <- cv.glm(Auto, glm_fit, K = 10)$delta[1]
}
##
plot(cv_error_10, type="b", ylab="Test MSE", xlab="Polynomial Degree",
     col = "black", bg = "black", pch = 21, main="10-fold CV")
```

We still see little evidence that using cubic or higher-order polynomial terms leads to lower test error than simply using a quadratic fit.

Notice that the computation time is shorter than that of LOOCV.

(In principle, the computation time for LOOCV for a least squares linear model should be faster than for $k$-fold CV, due to the availability of the formula @eq-CVfast for LOOCV; however, unfortunately the `cv.glm()` function does not make use of this formula.) 

We saw in @sec-RLabLOOCV that the two numbers associated with `delta` are essentially the same when LOOCV is performed. When we instead perform $k$-fold CV, then the two numbers associated with `delta` differ slightly. The first number is the standard $k$-fold CV estimate, as in @eq-kfoldCV. The second is a bias-corrected version. On this data set, however, the two estimates are very similar to each other.

### The Bootstrap

We illustrate the use of the bootstrap revisiting the portfolio choice example from above, as well as on an example involving estimating the accuracy of the linear regression model on the `Auto` data set.

#### Estimating the Accuracy of a Statistic of Interest

One of the great advantages of the bootstrap approach is that it can be applied in almost all situations. No complicated mathematical calculations are required. Performing a bootstrap analysis in `R` entails only two steps: 

* First, we must create a function that computes the statistic of
interest. 
* Second, we use the `boot()` function, which is part of the `boot` library, to perform the bootstrap by repeatedly sampling observations from the data set with replacement.

The `Portfolio` data set in the `ISLR2` package is simulated data of $100$ pairs of returns, generated in the fashion described above, where we introduced the portfolio example.

To illustrate the use of the bootstrap on this data, we must first create a function, `alpha_fn()`, which takes as input the $(X,Y)$ data as well as a vector indicating which observations should be used to estimate $\alpha$. The function then outputs the estimate for $\alpha$ based on the selected observations.

```{r chunk11}
alpha_fn <- function(data, index) {
  X         <- data$X[index]
  Y         <- data$Y[index]
  alpha_hat <- (var(Y) - cov(X, Y)) / (var(X) + var(Y) - 2 * cov(X, Y))
  return(alpha_hat)
}
```

This function returns an  estimate for $\alpha$ based on applying @eq-alpha to the observations indexed by the argument `index`. For instance, the following command tells `R` to estimate $\alpha$ using all of the $100$ observations.
```{r chunk12}
alpha_fn(data  = Portfolio, 
         index = 1:100) # complete original dataset
```

The next command  uses the `sample()` function to randomly select $100$ observations from the range $1$ to $100$, with replacement. This is equivalent to constructing a new bootstrap data set and recomputing $\hat{\alpha}$ based on the new data set.
```{r chunk13}
set.seed(7)
alpha_fn(data  = Portfolio, 
         index = sample(x=1:100, size=100, replace = TRUE))
```

We can implement a bootstrap analysis by performing this command many times, recording all of the corresponding estimates for $\alpha$, and computing the resulting standard deviation. (We use this approach above.)

However, the `boot()` function automates this approach. Below we produce $R=1,000$ bootstrap estimates for $\alpha$.
```{r chunk14}
boot(data      = Portfolio, 
     statistic = alpha_fn, 
     R         = 1000)
```

The final output shows that using the original data, $\hat{\alpha}=0.5758$,
and that the bootstrap estimate for $\operatorname{SE}(\hat{\alpha})$ is $0.0897$.

#### Estimating the Accuracy of a Linear Regression Model 

The bootstrap approach can be used  to assess the variability of the coefficient estimates and predictions from a statistical learning method. Here we use the bootstrap approach in order to assess the variability of the estimates for $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$, the intercept and slope terms for the linear regression model that uses  `horsepower` to predict `mpg` in the `Auto` data set. We will compare the estimates obtained using the bootstrap to those obtained using the formulas for ${\rm SE}(\hat{\beta}_0)$ and ${\rm SE}(\hat{\beta}_1)$ described in Chapter 3.1.2.

We first create a simple function, `boot_fn()`, which takes in the `Auto` data set as well as a set of indices for the observations, and returns the intercept and slope estimates for the linear regression model. We then apply this function to the full set of $392$ observations in order to compute the estimates of $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ on the entire data set using the usual linear regression coefficient estimate formulas from Chapter 3. 
```{r chunk15}
## Function to compute coefficient estimates using lm()
boot_fn <- function(data, index){
  coef(lm(mpg ~ horsepower, 
          data   = data, 
          subset = index))
}

## Sample size
n <- nrow(Auto)

## Coeficient estimates using the total sample
boot_fn(data  = Auto, 
        index = 1:n)
```

The `boot_fn()` function can also be used in order to create bootstrap estimates for the intercept and slope terms by randomly sampling from among the observations with replacement. Here we give two examples.

```{r chunk16}
set.seed(1)

boot_fn(data  = Auto, 
        index = sample(1:n, n, replace = TRUE))
boot_fn(data  = Auto, 
        index = sample(1:n, n, replace = TRUE))
```

Next, we use the `boot()` function to compute the standard errors of $R=1,000$ bootstrap estimates for the intercept and slope terms.
```{r chunk17}
boot_obj <- boot(data      = Auto, 
                 statistic = boot_fn, 
                 R         = 1000)
boot_obj                 
```
This indicates that the bootstrap estimate for ${\rm SE}(\hat{\beta}_0)$ is $0.84$, and that the bootstrap estimate for ${\rm SE}(\hat{\beta}_1)$ is $0.0073$. 

The reported `bias` equals the difference between the sample means of the bootstrap realizations and the full sample estimates:
```{r}
## estimated biases: 
colMeans(boot_obj$t) - boot_obj$t0
```


As discussed in Chapter 3.1.2, standard formulas can be used to compute the standard errors for the regression coefficients in a linear model. These can be obtained using the  `summary()` function.
```{r chunk18}
summary(lm(mpg ~ horsepower, data = Auto))$coef
```

The standard error estimates for $\hat{\beta}_0$ and $\hat{\beta}_1$ obtained using the formulas from Chapter 3.1.2 are $0.717$ for the intercept and $0.0064$ for the slope. 

Interestingly, these are somewhat different from the estimates obtained using the bootstrap. Does this indicate a problem with the bootstrap? In fact, it suggests the opposite.  Recall that the standard formulas given in Equation 3.8 (Chapter 3.1.2) rely on certain assumptions. For example, they depend on the unknown parameter $\sigma^2$, the noise variance. We then estimate $\sigma^2$ by $\operatorname{RSS}/(n-p-1).$ Now although the formulas for the standard errors do not rely on the linear model being correct, the estimate for $\sigma^2$ does. We see in Figure 3.8 of our textbook that there is a non-linear relationship in the data, and so the residuals from a linear fit will be inflated, and so will $\hat{\sigma}^2$.


Moreover, the standard formulas assume (somewhat unrealistically) that the $x_i$ are fixed, and all the variability comes from the variation in the errors $\epsilon_i$. The bootstrap approach does not rely on any of these assumptions, and so it is likely giving a more accurate estimate of the standard errors of $\hat{\beta}_0$ and $\hat{\beta}_1$ than is the `summary()` function.

Below we compute the bootstrap standard error estimates and the standard
linear regression estimates that result from fitting the quadratic model to the data. 
```{r chunk19}
boot_fn <- function(data, index)
  coef(lm(mpg ~ horsepower + I(horsepower^2), 
        data = data, subset = index))

set.seed(1)
boot(data      = Auto, 
     statistic = boot_fn, 
     R         = 1000)

summary(lm(mpg ~ horsepower + I(horsepower^2), data = Auto))$coef
```

Since the quadratic model provides a good fit to the data (Figure 3.8 of our textbook), there is now a better correspondence between the bootstrap estimates and the standard estimates of ${\rm SE}(\hat{\beta}_0)$, ${\rm SE}(\hat{\beta}_1)$ and ${\rm SE}(\hat{\beta}_2)$.
